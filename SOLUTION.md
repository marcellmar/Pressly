# Pressly MVP Solution Guide

If you're experiencing freezing issues with the React application, this guide offers simple solutions to get Pressly up and running.

## Emergency Solution (Recommended)

If npm start is freezing and all other attempts to resolve it fail, the fastest way to see the application is:

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the project folder:
   ```
   cd ~/Desktop/pressly-mvp-react-main
   ```

2. Make the emergency script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x emergency.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```
   ./emergency.sh
   ```

This will start a simple server that doesn't rely on Node.js and shows either:
- The built React application (if available)
- A static fallback version of the Pressly website
- A help page with further instructions

## Alternative Solutions

### Try Building the Application

If you want to attempt building a production version:

```
chmod +x build_and_run.sh
./build_and_run.sh
```

### Fix Node.js Issues

If you want to attempt a more comprehensive fix:

1. Delete node_modules and reinstall:
   ```
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. Increase Node memory for React:
   ```
   export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"
   npm start
   ```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Error: ETIMEDOUT"
This is usually caused by duplicate module files or circular dependencies. Try:
```
find ./node_modules/lodash -name "*\ 2.js" -delete
```

### Freezing on Startup
Usually caused by memory issues. Try increasing memory allocation:
```
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" npm start
```

## Getting More Help

If you continue to experience issues, you may need to:

1. Check your Node.js version (try v16 or v18)
2. Reinstall npm globally
3. Consider using a different JavaScript runtime like Bun or Deno
